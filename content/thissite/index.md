# 

I decided to built a website for myself as a fun little side project. After using Wordpress, Shopify and more easy solutions i decided to build it completely for free, on top of open source software. 

## Tech

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Super fast static pages, using markdown. This is my first time using it, and it's been a cool experience where I have learned how fast static pages are, how adaptable and cool markdown is, an how to build websites more or less from scratch. 

The site is built with the [Console Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-console/). With a lots of modifications. 

For hosting i'm using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which offers the ability to host from any content source. Also it's free?!  

The project lives on my [github](https://github.com/jonasjahnsson/jonasjahnsson). Feel free to have a look and fork anything you find useful. The front page is my most custom, take a peep at index.html.  

My one sin is that i'm using Google Analytics to track all of you (i'm sorry). Old habits die hard. Also Matomo costs money.   




## Future

I would like to experiement either with creating some simple games to host or try to build a some simple dApps. Everything to be hosted here. Any ideas? Hit me up [Link](jonasjahnsson.com/contact)
