### [Gitcoin + Unicef]

Grants rounds are cool, and the coolest of all of them might we when I ran a round with Unicef. It felt really cool to work with someone as Unicef. It was the first time a round was run on the new Gitcoin Grants stack which hopefully can impact communities around the world. 

There was also a piece on me in my local newspaper during this time. [Click](https://www.venneslatidende.no/naeringsliv/i/l3M8kL/jonas-30-jobber-internasjonalt-med-kryptovaluta-finnes-utrolig-mange-muligheter)
