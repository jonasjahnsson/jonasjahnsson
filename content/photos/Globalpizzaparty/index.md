### Global Pizza Party 

Sometimes I catch myself wondering: why am I so drawn to the crypto space? Sure, the tech is fascinating, yada yada‚Äîbut honestly? It‚Äôs the vibes. The energy here is unmatched, and this community? Absolutely my favorite.  

One of the most unique traditions we have is Global Pizza Party, held every May 22nd to honor the legendary moment [Laszlo Hanyecz](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/10-years-after-laszlo-hanyecz-bought-pizza-with-10k-bitcoin-he-has-no-regrets/) traded 10,000 Bitcoin for a pizza. Yep, that‚Äôs billions in today‚Äôs value. Wild, right? Shoutout to PizzaDAO, the heroes who hustle year-round to keep this tradition alive and well-fed.

In year one, we had 22 attendees. Next year? We're aiming for a slice of something much bigger üçï
