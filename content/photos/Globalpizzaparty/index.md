### Global Pizza Party 

Sometimes I wonder why i'm so attracted to the crypto space. The tech is cool blah blah. The vibes, the vibes are so essential, and this is my favorite community. Global Pizza Party is a celebration happening every year on 22nd of May celebrating the time [Laszo](hhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/10-years-after-laszlo-hanyecz-bought-pizza-with-10k-bitcoin-he-has-no-regrets/) bought a pizza for 10 000 Bitcoin. Thats billions now if you wonder. There is a organization called PizzaDAO that works year around to secure funds.  

Year one we had 22 people attending, aiming higher next year!
