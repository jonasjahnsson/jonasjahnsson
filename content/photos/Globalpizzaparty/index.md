### Global Pizza Party 

One of the most unique traditions we have is Global Pizza Party, held every May 22nd to honor the legendary moment [Laszlo Hanyecz](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/10-years-after-laszlo-hanyecz-bought-pizza-with-10k-bitcoin-he-has-no-regrets/) traded 10,000 Bitcoin for a pizza. Billions of $$$ today. Wild, right? 

Travelling the world I've attended multiple Pizza Parties, to connect, learn and share the Crypto narrative. 

Shoutout to [PizzaDAO](https://www.globalpizzaparty.xyz/), the heroes who hustle year-round to keep this tradition alive and well-fed.

In year 1, we had 22 attendees in a little town in Norway. Next year? We're aiming for a slice of something much bigger üçï
