### Permissionless III Hackathon Salt Lake City, Utah

Hosting in-person hackathons is great! You meet brilliant builders creating new ways to tackle problems and building solutions that never stops to impress me.
Permissionless III was a personal highlight, with amazing builders from all around the world coming together to work trough what has honestly been a tough year (so far!) in crypto.
