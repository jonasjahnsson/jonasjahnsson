# Exploring My Focus Areas in Crypto: Scaling, Onboarding, and Building a Better Future

When I first dove into the crypto space, I was captivated by the promise of decentralized technology. But more than the tech itself, what truly resonated with me was its potential to make real, tangible change—scaling solutions for massive adoption, bringing onboard the next billion users, empowering developers, and funding public goods that serve everyone. If you know me, you’ll know I’m not just about theory—I’m all about practical, scalable solutions that drive meaningful growth.

Here’s a closer look at my key areas of focus and what excites me about them.

## Scaling: Unlocking the Internet of Value

Scaling blockchains isn’t just about throughput and numbers (though, wow, those TPS is wild). For me, it’s about building a solid foundation for real-world use cases. Whether it’s optimizing grants programs at Gitcoin or exploring innovative scalability solutions like rollups and modular chains, I love diving deep into the tech and strategy that ensures Web3 can handle what the future throws at it.

Scalability isn’t a buzzword; it’s a necessity. After all, what’s the point of building the future of finance, art, or gaming if it crashes under the weight of its own success?

## Onboarding: Crypto for Everyone

I’ll admit, the first time I tried to explain "seed phrases" to my mom, it was... an experience. Onboarding the next wave of users is about making crypto intuitive, accessible, and dare I say it, enjoyable.

Through my work at Gitcoin, buidlbox, and beyond, I’ve seen firsthand how powerful education and user-centric design can be. It’s not just about the tech; it’s about storytelling—helping people see how Web3 fits into their lives. If we want mainstream adoption, we need to make crypto as seamless as logging into Netflix or tapping your card at the coffee shop.

## DevRel: Empowering the Builders

Developers are the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem. Without them, we’re all just playing with ideas and hoping someone else turns them into reality. That’s why I’ve dedicated so much of my career to developer relations and seeing them succeed.

Hackathons? Love them. Building communities where devs can thrive? Even better. At buidlbox we created spaces where builders can connect, learn, and create the next generation of blockchain innovations. Seeing someone’s “aha moment” when they ship their first dApp or integrate a new protocol never gets old.

## Growth: The Balancing Act of Scale and Sustainability

Growth in crypto is a different beast. You’re not just chasing clicks or signups—you’re building networks, ecosystems, and communities. It’s a mix of art and science, strategy and serendipity.

Whether it’s growing grants programs, scaling hackathon platforms, or supporting clients in the eCommerce space, my approach has always been about authenticity. Growth isn’t just about numbers on a graph; it’s about creating real value for real people.

## Public Goods Funding: A Cause Close to My Heart

Public goods are the backbone of any thriving ecosystem, yet they’re often overlooked or underfunded. Through my work with Gitcoin, I’ve seen how innovative mechanisms like quadratic funding can change the game, making it easier for communities to support the projects they care about.

Crypto has the potential to redefine how we fund and sustain public goods—not just in Web3, but in the world at large. And that’s something I’m incredibly proud to contribute to.

## Consensys Layer: Building the Future, Layer by Layer

Last but not least, I’ve had the privilege of working closely with some incredible teams tackling the challenges of the Consensys layer. From tooling for developers to ensuring secure and efficient consensus mechanisms, this work has given me a front-row seat to some of the most exciting innovations in the space.

For me, this layer represents the “heart” of blockchain—where trust, security, and decentralization come together to power everything.

## A Final Thought

At the end of the day, what keeps me motivated in this space is the belief that we’re building something bigger than ourselves. Crypto isn’t just about tech or money—it’s about creating opportunities, empowering individuals, and solving problems in ways we never could before.

If any of this resonates with you, let’s chat. Whether you’re a project in need of scaling advice, a dev looking for support, or someone curious about how crypto can make a difference—I’d love to hear from you.

Let’s buidl the future, one block at a time.
