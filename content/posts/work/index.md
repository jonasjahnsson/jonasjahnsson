Ever since I roamed the internet as a P2P filesharing kingpin in the mid 00's I've been captivated by the promise of decentralized technology. But more than the tech itself, what truly resonated with me was its potential to make real world solutions to some of society's biggest problems, empowering developers, funding public goods that serve everyone. My goal has always been to create scalable solutions that drive meaningful growth. 

Here’s a closer look at my key areas of focus and what excites me about them.

## Scaling: Unlocking the Internet of Value

Scaling Ethereum is not about throughput and numbers. For me, it’s about building a solid foundation for real-world use cases. Whether it’s optimizing grants programs at Gitcoin or exploring innovative scalability solutions like rollups and AVSs, I love diving deep into the tech and strategy that ensures Ethereum can handle what the future throws at it. Importantly we need to scale in talent; onboard the next generation of builders and lay the foundations for their success. 

Scalability isn’t a buzzword; it’s a necessity. After all, what’s the point of building the future of finance, art, or gaming if it crashes under the weight of its own success?

## DevRel: Empowering the Builders

Developers are the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem. Without them, we’re all just playing with ideas and hoping someone else turns them into reality. That’s why I spend so much energy supporting and onboarding builders. 

Hackathons? Love them. Building communities where devs can thrive? Even better. At buidlbox we created spaces where builders can connect, learn, and create the next generation of innovations. Seeing someone’s “aha moment” when they ship their first dApp or integrate a new protocol never gets old.

## Growth: The Balancing Act of Scale and Sustainability

Growth in crypto is a different beast. You’re not just chasing clicks or signups—you’re building networks, ecosystems, and communities. It’s a mix of art and science, strategy and serendipity.

Whether it’s growing grants programs, scaling hackathons, I believe in authenticity. Growth isn’t just about numbers on a graph; it’s about creating real value for real people.(even though I love numbers lol)

## Public Goods: We Need to Fund What Matters

Public goods are the backbone of any thriving ecosystem, yet they’re often overlooked or underfunded. Through my work with Gitcoin, I’ve seen how innovative mechanisms like quadratic funding can change the game, making it easier for communities to support the projects they care about.

Crypto has the potential to redefine how we fund and sustain public goods — not just in Web3, but in the world at large. And that’s something I’m incredibly proud to contribute to.

## Consensys Layer: Building the Future, Layer by Layer

As an OG Ethereum miner, the post-Merge era presents a landscape rich with opportunity and innovation. Ensuring strong incentives for solo stakers is crucial to maintaining Ethereum’s decentralization. In this new phase, how can we make it even more attractive to stake your eth? Hmmm •ᴗ•

I’m optimistic that ongoing advancements in the Consensys Layer will drive Ethereum’s scalability — both horizontally and vertically. Wen [Pectra](https://transak.com/blog/a-breakdown-of-ethereum-pectra-upgrade-eip-lists-release-date)?

## A Final Thought

At the end of the day, we've come a long way. The future of Ethereum is brighter than ever and I want to do my best to use my energy to make sure Ethereum grows in all the ways it's intended to. 

If any of this resonates with you, let’s chat. Whether you’re a project in need of input, a dev looking for support, or someone curious about how crypto can make a difference - I’d love to hear from you.

Let’s buidl the future, one block at a time.
