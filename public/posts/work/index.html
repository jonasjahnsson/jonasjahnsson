When I first dove into the crypto space, I was captivated by the promise of decentralized technology.

<p>When I first dove into the crypto space, I was captivated by the promise of decentralized technology. But more than the tech itself, what truly resonated with me was its potential to make real, tangible change—scaling solutions for massive adoption, bringing onboard the next billion users, empowering developers, and funding public goods that serve everyone. My goal has always been to create scalable solutions that drive meaningful growth.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at my key areas of focus and what excites me about them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="scaling-unlocking-the-internet-of-value">Scaling: Unlocking the Internet of Value</h2>
<p>Scaling Ethereum is not about throughput and numbers. For me, it’s about building a solid foundation for real-world use cases. Whether it’s optimizing grants programs at Gitcoin or exploring innovative scalability solutions like rollups and AVS&rsquo;s, I love diving deep into the tech and strategy that ensures Web3 can handle what the future throws at it. Most importantaly we need to scale in talent; onboard the next generation of builders and lay the foundations for their success.</p>
<p>Scalability isn’t a buzzword; it’s a necessity. After all, what’s the point of building the future of finance, art, or gaming if it crashes under the weight of its own success?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="onboarding-crypto-for-everyone">Onboarding: Crypto for Everyone</h2>
<p>I’ll admit, the first time I tried to explain &ldquo;seed phrases&rdquo; to my mom, it was&hellip; an experience. Onboarding the next wave of users is about making crypto intuitive, accessible, and dare I say it, enjoyable.</p>
<p>Through my work at Gitcoin, buidlbox, and beyond, I’ve seen firsthand how powerful education and user-centric design can be. It’s not just about the tech; it’s about storytelling—helping people see how Web3 fits into their lives. If we want mainstream adoption, we need to make crypto as seamless as logging into Netflix or tapping your card at the coffee shop.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="devrel-empowering-the-builders">DevRel: Empowering the Builders</h2>
<p>Developers are the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem. Without them, we’re all just playing with ideas and hoping someone else turns them into reality. That’s why I spend so much energy to support and onboard builders.</p>
<p>Hackathons? Love them. Building communities where devs can thrive? Even better. At buidlbox we created spaces where builders can connect, learn, and create the next generation of innovations. Seeing someone’s “aha moment” when they ship their first dApp or integrate a new protocol never gets old.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="growth-the-balancing-act-of-scale-and-sustainability">Growth: The Balancing Act of Scale and Sustainability</h2>
<p>Growth in crypto is a different beast. You’re not just chasing clicks or signups—you’re building networks, ecosystems, and communities. It’s a mix of art and science, strategy and serendipity.</p>
<p>Whether it’s growing grants programs, scaling hackathons, I beliveve in authenticity. Growth isn’t just about numbers on a graph; it’s about creating real value for real people.(even though I love numbers lol)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="public-goods-we-need-to-fund-what-matters">Public Goods: We need to Fund what Matters</h2>
<p>Public goods are the backbone of any thriving ecosystem, yet they’re often overlooked or underfunded. Through my work with Gitcoin, I’ve seen how innovative mechanisms like quadratic funding can change the game, making it easier for communities to support the projects they care about.</p>
<p>Crypto has the potential to redefine how we fund and sustain public goods — not just in Web3, but in the world at large. And that’s something I’m incredibly proud to contribute to.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="consensys-layer-building-the-future-layer-by-layer">Consensys Layer: Building the Future, Layer by Layer</h2>
<p>As an OG eth miner, the dawn of the post-merge world is a world ful off opportunity and innovation. The imporantance of strong incentives for solo-stakers to keep Ethereum decentralized can&rsquo;t be understated. What&rsquo;s exciting is that we already have restaking, making the eth secure more services with no additional capital cost. I&rsquo;m hopeful these services will continue to see growth and enable the acceleration of Web 2.0 services in Web 3.0.</p>
<h2 id="im-hopeful-the-continued-improvements-of-the-consensys-layer-will-enable-to-ethereum-to-scale-both-horizontally-and-vertically">I&rsquo;m hopeful the continued improvements of the Consensys Layer will enable to Ethereum to scale both horizontally and vertically.</h2>
<h2 id="a-final-thought">A Final Thought</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, what keeps me motivated in this space is the belief that we’re building something bigger than ourselves. Crypto isn’t just about tech or money - it’s about creating opportunities, empowering individuals, and solving problems in ways we never could before.</p>
<p>If any of this resonates with you, let’s chat. Whether you’re a project in need of input, a dev looking for support, or someone curious about how crypto can make a difference - I’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Let’s buidl the future, one block at a time.</p>
