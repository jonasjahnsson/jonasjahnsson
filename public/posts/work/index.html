<p>The web3 revolution is more than just a shift in technology—it’s a movement that empowers individuals, decentralizes control, and fosters global collaboration. My career has been a journey through data, entrepreneurship, and open-source advocacy, ultimately leading me to the forefront of this transformative space.</p>
<h2 id="from-ecommerce-to-entrepreneurship-the-foundations-of-growth">From Ecommerce to Entrepreneurship: The Foundations of Growth</h2>
<p>I started my career at <strong>Netthandelen</strong> (now part of <strong>Brandsdal Group</strong>) at just 19, diving headfirst into the world of ecommerce. Analyzing data and implementing cutting-edge technologies, I helped drive sales and scale operations for one of the Nordic region’s largest ecommerce platforms. It was there I developed a deep understanding of how technology and strategy converge to create value.</p>
<p>This foundation inspired me to build something of my own—<strong>tickettothemoon.no</strong>, an ecommerce business selling hammocks. Over three years, I transformed it into a <strong>$3M venture</strong>, learning every facet of running a successful ecommerce operation. From supply chain management to customer acquisition, these lessons prepared me for my next big leap: Web3.</p>

<h2 id="entering-web3-scaling-impact-with-gitcoin">Entering Web3: Scaling Impact with Gitcoin</h2>
<p>As crypto gained momentum, I found myself drawn to the ethos of decentralization and open-source collaboration. A close friend introduced me to <strong>Gitcoin</strong>, and when the opportunity arose to join their marketing team, I seized it.</p>
<p>At Gitcoin, I focused on growing participation in <strong>Grants Rounds</strong>, engaging donors, and creating strategies to amplify community involvement. We tried everything from creating massive waves of <strong>POAPs</strong> (so many that we pushed POAP’s capacity to its limits!) to designing innovative ways to inspire engagement. Some experiments worked brilliantly, while others offered valuable lessons. What fueled me was the challenge of bridging people, technology, and purpose—unlocking new ways to support builders and projects in the space.</p>
<h2 id="empowering-builders-at-buidlbox">Empowering Builders at buidlbox</h2>
<p>After Gitcoin, I joined <strong>buidlbox</strong>, a hackathon platform that partners with leading Web3 brands to empower developers. My role centered on creating an <strong>analytics framework</strong> to measure both product performance and marketing efforts. Beyond data, my true passion lies in the stories of the builders themselves.</p>
<p>Seeing developers enter Web3, learn new skills, and turn their ideas into real-world solutions is incredibly rewarding. At buidlbox, I’ve had the privilege of supporting some of the most talented minds in the space, helping them gain visibility and opportunities to thrive.</p>

<h2 id="why-web3">Why Web3?</h2>
<p>For as long as I’ve owned a computer, I’ve been captivated by <strong>open-source software</strong> and <strong>peer-to-peer technologies</strong>. Web3 represents the culmination of these ideals, offering a future where creators, developers, and communities have greater control and ownership.</p>
<p>Whether it’s through decentralized funding models, platforms that empower builders, or tools that make Web3 accessible to all, I’m committed to advancing the space. My journey has always been about creating, innovating, and connecting—and Web3 is where these passions come alive.</p>
<h2 id="lets-build-the-future-together">Let’s Build the Future Together</h2>
<p>I’m eager to continue contributing to the Web3 ecosystem, whether through growth strategies, community building, or developing the tools that enable the next wave of innovation. If you’re looking for someone who thrives on experimentation, brings a builder’s mindset, and has a deep love for decentralized technologies, let’s connect.</p>
<p>The future of Web3 is being written right now—and I’d love to be part of the story.</p>
